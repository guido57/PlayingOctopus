# PlayingOctopus
 
## Overview 

I got the idea watching the traditional wind-chimes and guessing how they could be played automatically.
Here you'll find all the software necessary to playing Octopus, while the hardware project is here: https://hackaday.io/project/195138-playing-octopus

The main distinctive capabilities of this building are:
1) It can play 1 selectable track of any MIDI file by the 6 tubular bells
2) the whole tune (all the MIDI tracks) is played by the loudspeaker
3) the software, by a web interface, allows to:
   * search the MIDI file from thousands of songs
   * select the track to be played by the octopus
   * tune the mallet movements (target, rest, speed)
